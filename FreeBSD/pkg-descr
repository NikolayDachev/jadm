JADM is a easy FreeBSD jail framework with /etc/jail.conf, vnet and zfs support

At the moment is in development process, still alot of functions should be tested and added.

!! Use it in production system on your own risk !!

Any 'bug' which is reported to jadm@dachev.info will help me to speed up development process
